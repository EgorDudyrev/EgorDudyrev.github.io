      "abstract": "During the talk, we will discuss how one can find stable patterns and implications in the datasets using Formal Concept Analysis. The field of FCA has a strong mathematical background in Lattice and Set theories. However, in this talk, I will omit the formal definitions and I will rely more on the semantics of FCA that mimic some ways humans understand the world (and data).\n So we will consider some real-world datasets and we will use FCA-based software.  With this tool we will find the implications like “if values of a numerical column lie in interval X and values of a categorical column belong to set Y, then all values of a textual column contain n-grams Z”.\n I hope that the presented techniques will help you with your data analysis tasks, and that your future success stories will help us improve and promote the presented techniques.",
