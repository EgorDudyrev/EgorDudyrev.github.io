      `The paper, published in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning (Q1).
      My supervisors and I started working on the paper at the beginning of the year 2022.
      We set ourselves to find formal ways to measure the data complexity with the means of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).
      For example, we say that the data is complex if its concept lattice contains many incomparable concepts.
      And we have already planned some projects where we will apply these findings to the real-world industrial data.
      <br>
      The paper speaks in the language of Formal Concept Analysis, so it might be hard to read for people with no FCA background. 
      At the same time, it could be a nice place to learn lots of specific terminology like intents, pseudo-intents, keys, minimum generators, etc.
      <br>
      From the practical perspective, the paper motivated us to create a Python package [Caspailleur](https://github.com/EgorDudyrev/caspailleur), that performs many FCA-related computations efficiently.
      One can also check out the usage examples of Caspailleur in the [Expailleur](https://github.com/EgorDudyrev/expailleur) repository.
      All the examples run in Google Colab.
      <br>
      Finally, the preliminary results of the paper were presented at the [CLA 2022](https://cs.ttu.ee/events/cla2022/) conference and the SmartFCA reunion in January 2023.
